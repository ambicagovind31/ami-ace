-  I’m enthusiastic on physics problems suited for undergraduate research(I prefer theoretical over compuatational projects). 
-  Although my experience is mostly in astronomy I am open to all fields of physics!
-  Experienced in Python,TOPCAT,DS9 and scientific libraries, working knowledge of Git and LaTeX
- Collaborative research excites me and I'm happy to pursue a problem as part of a team.
